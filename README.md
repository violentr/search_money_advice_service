MAS-Technical-Test-Ruby
=======================

Technical Test for candidate


##Create an API that allows a user to search the Money Advice Service website. 
The user provides a search term, and gets back the title and url of the first article from the English site search, along with the title and url of the Welsh version of the article (if a Welsh version exists).
The application shouldn’t have a UI, just an endpoint.

##Purpose of the exercise
This is to enable us to evaluate your technical skills, as a second stage of the interview process. This test is meant to be unattended, and will be followed up by a pairing exercise with a senior member of the MAS development team.

##Requirements
Time
As we care primarily about your approach to the problem, implementing a “perfect” solution is not desirable or necessary. No more than 2 hours should be spent on the implementation.

##Commits
Commit regularly, as a real project would require. Commits should have an appropriate size, content, and message. Use Github commit message standards. A private repository with push/ pull permissions will be provided.

##Testing
The code has to be written in TDD (BDD) fashion.

##Documentation & comments
Document and comment as appropriate. Well-written Ruby code is a documentation of itself, but feel free to include a readme file if necessary.

##Evaluation criteria

We will be considering the following aspects of your solution:

* Code structure
  * Clarity and maintainability of application and test code
  * Adherence to Ruby and Rails community conventions
* Technical design
 * Overall architecture and design (not visual)
 * Appropriate use of object-oriented design principles
 * Design should be appropriate for the objective
 * Extensibility of your API
* Suitability of technologies used
 * Use of gems and third party libraries
 * Ruby on Rails is a must
